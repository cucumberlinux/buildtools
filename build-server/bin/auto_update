# This script automatically updates the packages for Cucumber Linux. It does
# the following:
#
#   1. Update the local copy of the ports tree.
#   2. Update the local packages directory (in /opt/packages/cucumber).
#   3. Build any updated packages.
#   4. Upload the packages in /opt/packages and the old packages to the
#      staging server.

# Update the local copy of the ports tree. We use rsync here to ensure that the
# modification times are correct (git does not preserve this). Additionally,
# rsync copies the source over from the staging server, so we can save some
# bandwidth if we have multiple buildservers on the same network.
portsync -r || exit 1

# Upload the local packages directory to ensure we do not accidentally delete a
# package due to our package directory being out of sync.
$(dirname $0)/download_packages || exit 1

# Build any updated packages.
portmake update-all || exit 1

# Upload the packages to the staging server.
